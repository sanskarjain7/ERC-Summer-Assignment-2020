# ERC-Summer-Assignment-2020

This repository contains the solutions for the following questions:

1. Use an arduino to measure the value of a resistor (between 0 and 1K), and
display the value on an LCD screen.

2. Use a potentiometer to control angle of a servo motor and display the
current angle on a 3-digit 7-segment display using an arduino as
microcontroller. (Hint: You can use the ​ CD4511​ IC).

3. Create a circuit using Arduino and an IR sensor/remote. The user should
be able to use the remote to do the following:
a. Control the brightness of a light bulb (not LED).
b. Set the speed of a DC motor as high, medium, low, or off.

4. Design a circuit for an automatic LED night light using LDR and LM741,
which is an op-amp IC.

The links to the Arduino simulation are given in the document ERC-Summer-Assignment
